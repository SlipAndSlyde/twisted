## Credit
Heavily inspired by Gravity by JamesOuO on Scratch:
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/31113926/

Unfortunately, Scratch 3 left the project half-broken, so I decided to program my own version, this time reborn in JavaScript!

Scripting:
- SAT framework by jriecken
- used some of my (SlipAndSlyde) frameworks:

Music:
- Cloud Chaser by Felocai
